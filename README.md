# cars-website
It is a frontend based car selling website but I have added backend to the LOGIN form and Get in touch form using PHP and MySQL.
Opening index.html using the web browser one can access the website.
All the images used in the project is stored in images folder.
CSS folder contains style.css file that contains CSS of the project
JS folder contains corresponding Javascript of the code.

To access The backend:-
1. Using Xampp ,first one have to move root folder of the project in xampp/htdocs
2.Using MySQL create database "CarWebsite" in collation mode.
 2.a)In this database create table login details with column name, email and passwd
 2.b)Create another table git with email, fname, msg, sub.
3.Then host using xampp>>apache>>mysql
4.Then goto website localhost/Car_Website
